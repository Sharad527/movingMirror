The neural operator we are going to build to solve this problem focusses on is different. Here there are two aspects of this neural network which makes it different from the rest
+ Matrix valued output of the network
+ Complex entries of the output along with weights, biases and activation function

  We wish to leverage these two facts to obtain the $\beta_{\omega k}$ function. The expression for $\beta_{\omega k}$ is given as
  $$
  \beta_{\omega k}=\int
  $$

  Write about how the network is matrix valued. include equations. also mention equations and why it is matrix valued
  write about the complex numbers and why it is required. show the implementation of complex activation function.

  Also make sure to add what are the pitfalls of the above.
